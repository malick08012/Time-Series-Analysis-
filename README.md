# Time-Series-Analysis-
This project aims to analyze and forecast future stock prices using time series analysis methods. The dataset provided contains historical stock prices, including daily information such as the opening, closing, highest, and lowest stock prices. The goal is to predict the future closing prices based on historical trends and patterns using various statistical techniques, with a focus on the ARIMA model.
Objectives:

Plot and decompose the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Implement moving average and exponential smoothing techniques to identify underlying trends.

Build an ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices.

Evaluate the model using performance metrics like RMSE and visualize the forecasts.

#Tools and Libraries Used:

Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn
