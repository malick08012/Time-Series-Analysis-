# Time-Series-Analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock prices using time series analysis in Python. We take historical stock data and walk through a full pipeline to understand trends, uncover seasonal patterns, and build a model to predict future prices.

🚀 What This Project Covers:

📅 Data Preparation: Cleaned and formatted time-series data, setting the date as an index for proper analysis.

🔍 Decomposition: Broke down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components to better understand stock behavior over time.

📉 Smoothing Techniques: Implemented Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing methods to reduce noise and highlight long-term trends.

📈 ARIMA Modeling: Built an ARIMA model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

📏 Model Evaluation: Used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's prediction accuracy.

📊 Visualization: Presented clear plots for data trends, decomposed components, and forecasted vs actual prices.

🎯 Why This Project?

Time series forecasting is a valuable skill in data science and finance. This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to:

Preparing real-world time series data

Applying classical forecasting methods

Evaluating and visualizing prediction results

It’s ideal for those interested in data analytics, financial modeling, or learning ARIMA-based forecasting from scratch.


Tools and Libraries Used:

Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn
